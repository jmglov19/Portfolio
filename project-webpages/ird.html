                    The IRD is a database that I developed for Bob’s Music. The database is for keeping record of all owned instruments, 
                    all current and past customers, and which customers have which instruments.
    
                    Before this was done by receipts that were printed on paper and then thrown into a binder. Whenever information 
                    was needed it had to be retrieved from a binder with over 300 papers in it that were usually not sorted at all. 
                    Obviously this was a big time waste and had the high likelihood to lose things. That is why I was asked to build 
                    this system. It would speed up the renting process severely and reduce the chance of information being lost.

                <h2>The Execution</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    The database was built with Microsoft’s SQL Server and hosted on a server I set up 
                    in the office with an old laptop. Therefore the database can be accessed by the owner 
                    whenever and wherever necessary. The interface was done in Python Using Tkinter. 
                    It allows the entry of new instruments, customers, and new “tickets” to assign an 
                    instrument to a customer in the database. There is also the ability to look up all 
                    relevant information of an instrument, a customer, or what instrument is associated with 
                    what customer. There is also the ability to edit this information within the GUI

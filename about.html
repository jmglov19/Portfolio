                I grew up in the North Country of New York playing soccer, golf and snowboarding. I have always enjoyed creating things and becoming
                a Software Engineer and Website Designer has allowed me to create some really cool progams adn projects. My favorite projects have been 
                my Database for Bob's Music and learning game development with my project "Road of Champions"
            </p>

                I also grew up with a love for music with both my parents being involved in music. I learned to play most instuments to a basic exstent being
                that my Mother is a music Teacher. The instument I would love to work on the most would be the guitar partly becasue that is waht my Father plays.
                My favorite type of music is Indie rock due to the clean guitar sounds and fast bpm but I really listen to all styles of music.
